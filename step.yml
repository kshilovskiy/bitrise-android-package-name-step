  This is a Step template.
  Contains everything what's required for a valid Stepman managed step.

  can be a [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) formatted text.

  To create your own Step:

  1. Create a new repository on GitHub
  2. Copy the files from this folder into your repository
  3. That's all, you can use it on your own machine
  4. Once you're happy with it you can share it with others.
